<p>So, I&apos;m finally going to do this. Write a dang blog. About stuff. Probably mostly tech stuff. Maybe include some stuff about beer. But I will write about things at least...</p>
<p>I&apos;ve already failed at my New Year&apos;s resolution of &apos;write one blog post a month&apos;, but hey, at least I am still trying, and can still end the year with above a 90% completion rate. And I&apos;ve kept up with my exercise routine too!</p>
<p>It&apos;s been 8 years since I had the genius idea (courtesy my Intro to Computer Science Class) of building a blog. Facebook just recently, so very kindly, reminded me of that very first attempt at building a website. Doesn&apos;t that stock photo of a ship look great! Due to my affliction, i-must-do-it-myself-syndrome, I had to do it the hard way, from scratch. But, oh, I was so proud of that hand written HTML that I shared it to the (Facebook) world, with what will very likely be the same virtual cricket applause that this blog itself will receive.</p>
<p>Honestly though, I&apos;ve taken a real stab at getting a blog up at running just about once a year for the past 3 or 4 years I believe. The result has been a new incarnation of a <a href="https://pages.github.com/?ref=localhost">GH-Pages</a> site somewhat hacked together, but not quite how I like it, so I get frustrated and quit because it doesn&apos;t look pretty.</p>
<p>But this time will most certainly be different. I&apos;ve got a dozen or so half finished projects laying around, and adding yet another project to the mix (this blog) will surely help them all along. So I will mostly leave off this post here. I finally got a new GH-Pages blog site up and running, and felt I needed to write at least one post to make this attempt a little more successful that the past tries. So I did.</p>
